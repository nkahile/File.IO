Goals; -the goal of this program is to take an input from an input file
and transfer it to an output file that is going to be made by the
program, for example if you're playing a game a character in the game
has certain characteristics that you changed, you don't want to change
the characteristics every time, instead, you save the characteristics,
so you have access to it whenever you run the game again.

Input; -The input file must be present for the program and the output
file to work

Output; -whatever the user wants to print out, it's going to print on
the output file, for example;

1,2,3 ham (in input file) becomes:

ham,ham,ham,ham,ham,ham (in output file)

Steps; -Declare ifstream to open input.txt -Declare ofstream to open
output.txt -make a while loop to loop over the line by using endl
function -declare string objects -use getline function -add string
values sum = (num1,num2,num3) -make a for loop to go over sum -1 -make
an outfile.close function and an infile.close function
